/// Raw mutex trait.
///
/// This mutex is "raw", which means it does not actually contain the protected data, it
/// just implements the mutex mechanism. For most uses you should use [`super::Mutex`] instead,
/// which is generic over a RawMutex and contains the protected data.
///
/// Note that, unlike other mutexes, implementations only guarantee no
/// concurrent access from other threads: concurrent access from the current
/// thread is allwed. For example, it's possible to lock the same mutex multiple times reentrantly.
///
/// Therefore, locking a `RawMutex` is only enough to guarantee safe shared (`&`) access
/// to the data, it is not enough to guarantee exclusive (`&mut`) access.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// RawMutex implementations must ensure that, while locked, no other thread can lock
/// the RawMutex concurrently.
///
/// Unsafe code is allowed to rely on this fact, so incorrect implementations will cause undefined behavior.

/// A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data
///
/// This mutex will block threads waiting for the lock to become available. The
/// mutex can be created via a [`new`] constructor. Each mutex has a type parameter
/// which represents the data that it is protecting. The data can only be accessed
/// through the RAII guards returned from [`lock`] and [`try_lock`], which
/// guarantees that the data is only ever accessed when the mutex is locked.
///
/// # Poisoning
///
/// The mutexes in this module implement a strategy called "poisoning" where a
/// mutex is considered poisoned whenever a thread panics while holding the
/// mutex. Once a mutex is poisoned, all other threads are unable to access the
/// data by default as it is likely tainted (some invariant is not being
/// upheld).
///
/// For a mutex, this means that the [`lock`] and [`try_lock`] methods return a
/// [`Result`] which indicates whether a mutex has been poisoned or not. Most
/// usage of a mutex will simply [`unwrap()`] these results, propagating panics
/// among threads to ensure that a possibly invalid invariant is not witnessed.
///
/// A poisoned mutex, however, does not prevent all access to the underlying
/// data. The [`PoisonError`] type has an [`into_inner`] method which will return
/// the guard that would have otherwise been returned on a successful lock. This
/// allows access to the data, despite the lock being poisoned.
///
/// [`new`]: Self::new
/// [`lock`]: Self::lock
/// [`try_lock`]: Self::try_lock
/// [`unwrap()`]: Result::unwrap
/// [`PoisonError`]: super::PoisonError
/// [`into_inner`]: super::PoisonError::into_inner
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
/// use std::thread;
/// use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
///
/// const N: usize = 10;
///
/// // Spawn a few threads to increment a shared variable (non-atomically), and
/// // let the main thread know once all increments are done.
/// //
/// // Here we're using an Arc to share memory among threads, and the data inside
/// // the Arc is protected with a mutex.
/// let data = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
///
/// let (tx, rx) = channel();
/// for _ in 0..N {
///     let (data, tx) = (Arc::clone(&data), tx.clone());
///     thread::spawn(move || {
///         // The shared state can only be accessed once the lock is held.
///         // Our non-atomic increment is safe because we're the only thread
///         // which can access the shared state when the lock is held.
///         //
///         // We unwrap() the return value to assert that we are not expecting
///         // threads to ever fail while holding the lock.
///         let mut data = data.lock().unwrap();
